# ToDo-List
This is a To-do list I created using HTML, CSS and JS. It only has a frontend component meaning that every time you refresh this page, you'll lose your previous data. I'm excited to learn backend webdev so that I can improve this project further. Special thanks to chatGPT for helping resolve an issue :)
